# Social Network API

## Description

This is an API for a social network web application, designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently using MongoDB. The API allows users to create and manage their profiles, share their thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and build a friend list. It leverages Express.js for routing and the Mongoose ODM for interacting with the MongoDB database.
